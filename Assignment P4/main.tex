\section{Question 1}

Create a thorough GOMS model for contacting a professor to ask for explanation of a grade

\begin{itemize}
\item
  Identify the initial situation
\item
  Describe the selection rules
\item
  Outline several methods
\item
  Identify the operators that comprise those methods (along with the estimated amount of time each operator takes to execute)
\item
  Describe the ultimate goal
\end{itemize}

You are not required to use the visualization schema seen in the lectures: you could use a simple outline format instead. However, your GOMS model should stand on its own with no explanatory text: every part of your submission should be a part of the initial situation, selection rules, methods, operators, or the final goal.
