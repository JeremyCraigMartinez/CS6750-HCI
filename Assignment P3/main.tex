\subsection{Principal 1 - Discoverability}
Discoverability can be used to create an invisible interface by building intuition into the interface. If a user can interact with a object that is foreign to them through an interface that is foreign to them, they must discover the actions to accomplish their goal. It must be possible to figure out what actions are possible and where and how to perform them. Further, we want to optimize our space and minimize the user's memory load by making these calls to action (CTA) visible.

\paragraph{Gulf of Execution}
One can leverage known industry standards, for example, in a web app so that the user instinctively knows where the menu is, how to find more options, etc. Through A/B testing and metric analysis, you can identify what your users main goals are, and surface those calls to action quicker to narrow the \textbf{gulf of execution}. For those users trying to accomplish more technical goals, we are comfortable de-emphasizing this gulf knowing that our implementation has reduced the gulf for the majority, while still appeasing to the advanced user (putting one more action in their gulf of execution).

\paragraph{Gulf of Evaluation}
Although more subtle in respect to discoverability, the user must have some intuition as to how their action impacted the system. The user

\clearpage

must be able to discover their action had the intended impact on the object without having to dig too deep. Each action should have an equal reaction in the interface that is visible and easy to discover.

\subsection{Principal 2 - Affordances}
"An affordance is a relationship between the proprties of an object and the capabilities of the agent that determine just how the object could be possibly used," (Norman, 1988). The design affords, or hints at, the way it is supposed to be used. This creates a mapping of how a physical object should be used with it's interface. Buttons are meant to be pressed, lids are meant to be lifted, wheels are meant to be rotated, etc. Just by looking at it, you can intuitive understand how it should be manipulated.

\paragraph{Gulf of Execution}
This can be tricky since an affordance is "jointly determined by the qualities of the object and the ability of the agent that is interacting," (Nielsen, 1994). Judging intuition can be challenging because everyone has different experience levels and backgrounds. For example, millenials will consider an aspect of a web interface intuitive that an elderly person may not. The gulf of execution can be greatly reduced using affordances because the symbol/object suggests how the user should interact with it, provided the user recognizes the object.

\paragraph{Gulf of Evaluation}
Affordances be definition should narrow the gulf of evaluation since the interface being manipulated should reflect the how you expect that object to be manipulated. A button should indent, a door handle should draw toward you, lifting a lid should cause the lid to go up.

\subsection{Principal 3 - Consistency}
Consistency should apply to one's implementation of an interface as well as the environment in which it is placed. One must stay consistent within their own interface, but must also stay consistent with industry standards. "Consistency in design is virtuous," (Norman, 1988).

\paragraph{Gulf of Execution}
In an attempt to reduce this gulf, one should leverage existing knowledge in their users. "Users should not have to wonder whether different words, situations, or actions mean the same thing. Follow platform conventions," (Nielson, 1994). If consistent with the users intuition, the interface will feel invisible. If it is inconsistent, they will likely be confused by the interface and how to research how to use it (or lose interest and look elsewhere).

\paragraph{Gulf of Evaluation}
Along the same lines as the gulf of execution, one should use industry standards for reflecting change in a UI. If a user is used to seeing a car turn right when the steering wheel turns right, then your car's wheel should do the same. A more subtle example: if you are developing a website, blue text should indicate a link to a new page, since the rest of the community has deemed this a standard. The user will evaluate their click based on if the interface has changed to a new page or not.


\subsection{Emphasizing the participant view}
\paragraph{Principal 1 - Ease and comfort}
The ease prinipal states that the design can be used efficiently and comfortably and with a minimum of fatigue. The comfort principal takes into account size and space and requires that an interface be within the reach and manipulation regardless of their users physical limitations. Both of these, by definition, take into account external factors. An application of ease of use could be how easy it is to use navigation app considering the user is driving. An application of the comfort principal would be how/where to place button on a smartphone so that it is accessible to the way most people hold a smartphone.

\paragraph{Principal 2 - Flexibility}
A user interface is flexible if it adheres to different users and situations. Providing multiple options for accomplishing the same task takes into account the knowledge of the user. However, it can also take into account their environment when performing the task. The old iPod shuffle's and nano's addressed this with selecting a next song. They discovered many of their users use the mp3 player while exercising. So they introduced a feature, targeted for that context, where the user can simply shake the device left-to-right and it will shuffle or select the next song.

\section{Question 2}

\subsection{Interface from everyday life - Venmo}
\link{https://venmo.com/}{Venmo} is a mobile application for sending/request money. Venmo is intolerant to errors, however, this is also a fundamental feature of the application. The interface has only five calls to action (CTA). Write a new request/payment, view payments of everyone/friends/personal, and the menu. When selecting a payment, you have to click the button twice, however, once you send a payment there is no undoing it. If this was an error, incorrect amount, wrong person, etc. there is no way to correct the mistake. This is partly what makes Venmo an acceptable payment method for transaction like in Craigslist, because the seller has certainty that the payment cannot be revoked. However, it is not a tolerant UI for mistakes (see Appendix A for screenshots).

One \textbf{constraint} that could be put in place is when sending money to an account for the first time. This could potentially mean there was a typo when entering the username and an extra screen asking the user if they know the recipient and intend to actually send it to this account would help deter people from making this mistake. This constraint would force the user to think twice and click twice that they do in fact want to send money to this completely new account they have never interacted with before.

Improved \textbf{mappings} could be put in place here to show the user exactly who they are sending money to. If the user does not have a profile picture with their account, the UI should provide a link to their corresponding Facebook account (if applicable). That way, the user can match the profile picture with the face of the person they want to send money to (if they have met face-to-face). Often times, just the user's initials appear with a username, which is sometimes cryptic and not indicative of the actual person you intend to send money to.

One \textbf{affordance} I've always enjoyed on mobile payment platforms is Amazon's. If you have a payment method on file, and your cart has an item in it, when clicking buy now you are prompted with a slide to complete the transaction. When sliding this bar (left to right), it feels like you are sending your money on over with the transaction. This affordance may be a bit of a stretch, but the action must be intentional and one could argue it mimic's the act of handing over cash in a hand-to-hand transaction. If Venmo applied this same affordance to their UI, it would make the transaction feel more concrete (see Appendix B for screenshots).

\section{Question 3 - Game}

First, describe a slip that a player of the game might make. Remember, a slip generally occurs when the player knows what action they should take, but does something different instead. In Tetris, this might be a player wanting to move a piece to the right, but pressing the left button instead. Then, describe why the player might make that slip. Then, briefly suggest a way the interface could be changed to prevent that slip in the future.

Second, describe a mistake that a player of the game might make. Remember, a mistake generally occurs when the player knows what they want to accomplish, but doesnâ€™t know how to actually make it happen. In Tetris, this might be a player wanting to rotate a piece clockwise, but pressing to rotate it counter-clockwise instead because they do not know which button rotates clockwise. Then, describe why the player might make that mistake. Then, briefly suggest a way the interface could be changed to prevent that mistake in the future.

Finally, describe something that makes the game challenging, but that is not a slip or a mistake. For example, in Tetris, there may be no obvious place for a piece to go, but that does not force the user to commit a slip or a mistake.

\section{Question 4}

From your everyday life, select an interface that you would argue uses a good representation of its underlying content. Describe the connections between the representation and the underlying content. Answer the question: in what ways does the representation exemplify at least two criteria of a good representation?

Then, select an interface that you would argue does not use a good representation of its underlying content. Describe the mismatch between the representation and the underlying content; in what ways does the representation violate at least two criteria of a good representation?
