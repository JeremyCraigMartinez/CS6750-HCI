\section{Question 1}

\subsection{Task 1}

\paragraph{Definition}
The task is... The goal of task 1 is... The interface for task 1 is... The object of task 1 is...

\paragraph{Directness and invisibility of interaction}
How are is your interaction from the object? To what extent are you directly manipulating the object rather than manipulating it at a distance through the interface? In terms of invisibility, how much time did you spend thinking about the interface rather than the task? If you focus mostly on the task, did the interface become invisible through learning or through good design? Was there a time when you thought more about the interface than you did now?

\subsection{Task 2}

\paragraph{Definition}
The task is... The goal of task 2 is... The interface for task 2 is... The object of task 2 is...

\section{Question 2}

Select an task that you do on a regular basis that has become invisible by learning. Describe the components of the interface you used to think about a lot.

Then, describe your thought process now, and especially explain why you no longer have to spend as much time focusing on the interface.

\paragraph{5 tips: invisible interfaces}
\begin{enumerate}
\item
  Use affordances - Places where the visual design of the interface is how it is supposed to be used
\item
  Know your user - Invisibility could mean different things
\item
  Differentiate your user - Provide multiple ways for accomplishing tasks to differentiate between users
\item
  Let your interface teach - Other than tutorials or manuals. Have your interface teach aspects of itself
\item
  Talk to your user - Ask them what their thinking while using an interface
\end{enumerate}

Finally, briefly describe how you might design or redesign the computational interface to get you to the point of invisibility more quickly. Tie in to the points above
